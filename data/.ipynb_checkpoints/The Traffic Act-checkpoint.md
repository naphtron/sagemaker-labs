|---|---|
|(h)|the sequence of the lights shown for the purpose of controlling the movement of vehicles shall be- (i) red; (ii) red and amber; (iii) green; (iv) amber.|

# Significance of traffic lights for vehicles.

The significance of the lights specified in rule 10 when illuminated shall be as follows-

- (a) the red light imposes a mandatory requirement that every vehicle travelling in that portion of the road or in the traffic lane to which the light applies shall stop before crossing the continuous white transverse line placed on the carriage-way and shall prohibit such crossing until- (i) the green light is illuminated; and (ii) such crossing can be accomplished without endangering or inconveniencing any other vehicle;
- (b) the amber and red lights shown together shall be taken to denote an impending change in the indication given by the traffic light signals from a red to a green light, but shall not in any way affect the mandatory requirement imposed by the red light;
- (c) the green light indicates that all vehicles may cross the said continuous white transverse line with due regard to the safety of other road users and subject to the directions of any police officer in uniform or other authorized person who may be engaged in the regulation of traffic;
- (d) the amber light shown alone imposes a mandatory requirement that every vehicle traveling in the carriageway or traffic lane to which that light applies shall stop before crossing the said continuous white transverse line, except in the case of any vehicle which, when that light is first illuminated, is so close to that line that it cannot safely be stopped before crossing that line;
- (e) notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this rule- (i) where a green arrow is shown in conjunction with a traffic light signal, a vehicle may proceed in the direction indicated by such arrow with due regard to the safety of other road users during such time as such arrow remains illuminated notwithstanding that it would otherwise be required by such signal to stop; (ii) where necessary a highway authority may apply any additional restriction of direction by indications on or near a traffic light signal.

# Traffic lights and their significance for pedestrians.

(1) A pedestrian traffic light signal unit may be used for controlling the movement of pedestrians, and in such case the unit shall incorporate either- (a) a light facing across the carriageway with a lens which, when
---
# Cap.403 Traffic [Rev. 2012

( Subsidiary) illuminated, shows either the words “CROSS” or “CROSS NOW” in white or green letters, or the figure of a walking pedestrian in green, against a black background; or

(b) two lights arranged vertically, each with a lens the centres of which are not more than 400 millimetres apart facing across the carriageway, the uppermost lens of which, when illuminated, shows the word “WAIT” in red letters or the figure of a stationary pedestrian in red, against a black background and the lowermost lens of which, when illuminated, shows the words “CROSS” or “CROSS NOW” in white or green letters or the figure of a walking pedestrian in green, against a black background.

(2) Each lens of a traffic light signal unit under this rule shall be separately illuminated, and the effective diameter thereof shall be not less than 200 millimetres nor more than 300 millimetres.

(3) The significance of the lights specified in this rule when illuminated shall be as follows-

(a) a white or green light indicates that pedestrians may commence and continue to cross the carriageway controlled by that light, within the area delineated by a carriageway marking consisting of two continuous white transverse lines, with due regard to the safety of other road users;

(b) a red light imposes a mandatory requirement that-

(i) pedestrians on such crossing place shall as soon as reasonably practicable give way to any traffic on the carriageway;

(ii) no pedestrian shall attempt or commence to cross the carriageway until the red light is extinguished.

(4) Any pedestrian who fails to comply with the mandatory requirement imposed by the red light under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding five hundred shillings.

Temporary traffic signs. 13. A traffic light signal unit may be used for the purpose of temporarily controlling the movement of vehicles on a road where road works are in progress, or where for some other reason the width of the carriageway is temporarily restricted in which case the provisions of rules 11 and 12 shall apply thereto save that-

(a) references to crossing a continuous white transverse line placed on the carriageway shall in the absence of such a line be deemed to include a reference to passing beyond the point where such unit is situated;

(b) the height of the centre of the green lens from the carriageway shall be not less than 1.50 metres and not greater than 2.30 metres;

(c) the amber signal may be excluded from such unit in which case it shall be so constructed that the red and the green lights are not illuminated at the same time and that the illumination of one shall follow the other without any appreciable interval of time;

(d) the legs which support such unit shall be painted in grey or in alternate black and white horizontal bands of equal width.

(b) the lines are crossed for the purpose of returning to the left-hand side of the road following a crossing or straddling which was lawful under subparagraph (a); and
